INSTALLATION: place in $KDEHOME/share/apps/katepart/script - For example: /home/USERNAME/.kde4/share/apps/katepart/script or /usr/share/apps/katepart/script ***

One last thing. "Wrap With Abbreviation" requires you to select some text, trigger the action (Default Shortcut Ctrl+Shift+w) and then input the abbreviation that will
wrap the selection. Since Kate's JavaScript API has no way of displaying an input box, the action, when triggered, will open the kate command line and place itself there.
Simply enter the abbreviation you want after the action name (delimited by space) and press enter. Zen will then expand the abbreviation and wrap your selection with it.
