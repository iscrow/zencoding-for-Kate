# zencoding-for-Kate
Back in 2012 I got zencoding to work with the Kate text editor. Adding here for posterity.

Initially I posted the code here [http://kate-editor.org/2012/01/21/scripting-in-kate/](https://web.archive.org/web/20121106182119/http://kate-editor.org/2012/01/21/scripting-in-kate/)

Some people liked it.

Someone posted it to github some time later [https://github.com/kursusHC/Zen-Coding-for-Kate](https://github.com/kursusHC/Zen-Coding-for-Kate)

Here's the original copy.
