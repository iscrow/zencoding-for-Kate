# zencoding-for-Kate
Back in 2012 I got zencoding to work with the Kate text editor. Adding here for posterity.

Initially I posted the code here [http://kate-editor.org/2012/01/21/scripting-in-kate/](https://web.archive.org/web/20121106182119/http://kate-editor.org/2012/01/21/scripting-in-kate/)

Some people liked it.

Someone posted it to github some time later [https://github.com/kursusHC/Zen-Coding-for-Kate](https://github.com/kursusHC/Zen-Coding-for-Kate)

The original link to dropbox I shared is still alive as of late 2021 [https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6yrn96l49b1hrb/zen.js](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6yrn96l49b1hrb/zen.js)
